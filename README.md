#adsb2kml

This is a library to make it easy to view [ADS-B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance-broadcast)
traffic in [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com).

It was originaly used as part of a presentation at [Imagine RIT](http://www.rit.edu/imagine/) where the data
was merged with [APRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) 
traffic from [aprs.fi](http://aprs.fi).
